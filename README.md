# OneMed1a - Unified Cross-Media Discovery App

> Your personalized hub for movies, books, TV shows, music, and podcasts—powered by recommendations and social discovery.

---

## What does this project do?

This project is developed by **Team 4** as part of the **University of Auckland SOFTENG 310 (Software Engineering Project)** course.
**OneMed1a** is a social and entertainment tracking web application that unifies users’ favorite media—movies, TV shows, books, and music—into one platform.

It enables users to:
- Track what they are watching, reading, or listening to
- Generate intelligent, cross-media recommendations (e.g., “you read this book, here’s the movie adaptation”)
- Connect with friends through a shared media activity feed
- Explore mood-aware and socially driven suggestions

---

## Why is this project useful?

Fragmented media platforms make it difficult to manage all the content people consume. **OneMed1a** addresses this by:
- Centralizing all media tracking in one place
- Recommending media across multiple domains (books to films, music to related shows, etc.)
- Offering a social feed of media activity among friends
- Suggesting top picks based on shared interests and friends’ ratings

This project also supports the SOFTENG 310 learning outcomes:
- Collaborative software development with GitHub
- Clear documentation and workflows
- Building maintainable and extensible software systems
